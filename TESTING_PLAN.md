# Comprehensive Testing Plan for FOUND IT App

## Overview
This testing plan covers all aspects of the FOUND IT app, including the new features and enhancements implemented:
1. Claiming system fixes
2. Deployment process changes
3. New item statuses ('recovered' and 'removed')
4. Enhanced item lifecycle management
5. Mobile app fixes and updates

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Unit Testing
Test individual components and functions in isolation.

#### 1.1 Claiming System Tests
- Verify that approved claims update item status to 'claimed'
- Verify that rejected claims return item to original status ('found' or 'lost')
- Test claim submission form validation
- Test claim approval/rejection notifications

#### 1.2 Status Management Tests
- Test setting items to 'recovered' status
- Test setting items to 'removed' status
- Test status transitions follow defined rules
- Test status history tracking

#### 1.3 API Tests
- Test new API endpoints for status management
- Test item retrieval with new statuses
- Test analytics API with new status counts

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
Test how different components work together.

#### 2.1 Database Integration Tests
- Test that new statuses are properly stored in the database
- Test that status history is correctly recorded
- Test that analytics are updated with new statuses

#### 2.2 Web Interface Tests
- Test that new statuses display correctly in all views
- Test that admin functionality works for new statuses
- Test that public views filter items correctly

#### 2.3 Mobile App Tests
- Test that the mobile app displays new statuses correctly
- Test that mobile app can filter items by new statuses
- Test that offline functionality works with new statuses

### Phase 3: System Testing
Test the complete system functionality.

#### 3.1 User Flow Tests
- Test complete flow from item posting to recovery/removal
- Test claiming process with new statuses
- Test admin workflow for managing items with new statuses

#### 3.2 Performance Tests
- Test page load times with new status data
- Test database query performance with new statuses
- Test mobile app performance with new features

#### 3.3 Security Tests
- Test that only authorized users can change statuses
- Test that API endpoints are properly secured
- Test that mobile app handles authentication correctly

### Phase 4: Acceptance Testing
Test that the system meets user requirements.

#### 4.1 User Acceptance Tests
- Test that users can see 'recovered' items in public views
- Test that 'removed' items are properly hidden from public views
- Test that the enhanced lifecycle management provides better tracking

#### 4.2 Admin Acceptance Tests
- Test that admins can easily manage items with new statuses
- Test that status history provides useful audit trail
- Test that analytics dashboard shows comprehensive data

## Test Cases

### TC001: Claim Approval Updates Item Status
**Preconditions:** Item exists with 'found' status, claim submitted
**Steps:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to claims management
3. Approve a pending claim
4. Check item status
**Expected Result:** Item status updated to 'claimed'

### TC002: Claim Rejection Maintains Original Status
**Preconditions:** Item exists with 'lost' status, claim submitted
**Steps:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to claims management
3. Reject a pending claim
4. Check item status
**Expected Result:** Item status remains 'lost'

### TC003: Set Item to Recovered Status
**Preconditions:** Item exists with 'found' status
**Steps:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to item management
3. Set item to 'recovered' status
4. Check item status
**Expected Result:** Item status updated to 'recovered'

### TC004: Set Item to Removed Status
**Preconditions:** Item exists with 'lost' status
**Steps:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to item management
3. Set item to 'removed' status
4. Check item status
**Expected Result:** Item status updated to 'removed'

### TC005: Status History Tracking
**Preconditions:** Item exists
**Steps:**
1. Change item status multiple times
2. View status history
**Expected Result:** All status changes recorded with timestamps

### TC006: Public View Filtering
**Preconditions:** Items exist with various statuses
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to public items page
2. Check displayed items
**Expected Result:** Only 'found', 'lost', and 'recovered' items displayed

### TC007: Mobile App Status Display
**Preconditions:** Mobile app installed, items with new statuses exist
**Steps:**
1. Open mobile app
2. View items list
3. Check status display
**Expected Result:** New statuses display with appropriate colors

### TC008: Deployment Trigger
**Preconditions:** GitHub workflow configured
**Steps:**
1. Make code change
2. Push to main branch
3. Check deployment
**Expected Result:** Deployment triggered only on push, not on app start

## Test Environment
