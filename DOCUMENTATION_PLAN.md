## Claiming System Updates

### Problem
Previously, when claims were approved, items were moved to 'archived' status and removed from recent items. When claims were rejected, items remained in 'claimed' status instead of returning to their original status.

### Solution
- Approved claims now update item status to 'claimed' and keep items visible in recent items
- Rejected claims now return items to their original status ('found' or 'lost')
- Enhanced claim management interface with better status tracking

### Implementation Details
- Modified `approve_claim` function in `app.py` to set item status to 'claimed'
- Modified `reject_claim` function in `app.py` to return item to original status
- Updated templates to display 'claimed' items in recent items list
- Added status history tracking for claims

## Deployment Process Changes

### Problem
The app was deploying automatically when the server started, which could cause unnecessary deployments.

### Solution
Implemented GitHub Actions workflow to only deploy on push events to the main branch.

### Implementation Details
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with push trigger
- Updated `render.yaml` to disable auto-deploy
- Modified `deploy.sh` to focus on database initialization only
- Added deployment secrets management in GitHub

### Configuration
1. Create GitHub repository secrets:
   - `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`: Your Render service ID
   - `RENDER_API_KEY`: Your Render API key

2. Update Render dashboard settings:
   - Disable "Auto Deploy" in the "Build & Deploy" section

## New Item Statuses

### Added Statuses
1. **recovered** - For items that have been successfully recovered by their owners
2. **removed** - For items that don't meet the standard and have been removed by admins

### Status Descriptions
- **found** - Item found by someone (default)
- **lost** - Item reported as lost
- **claimed** - Item claimed by owner (pending admin approval)
- **archived** - Item archived (final state after successful claim)
- **recovered** - Item successfully recovered by owner
- **removed** - Item removed by admin (doesn't meet standards)

### Status Transitions
```
found/lost → claimed → approved → archived
found/lost → recovered
found/lost → removed
claimed → rejected → found/lost (original status)
```

### Implementation Details
- Updated Item model status field comment
- Modified public routes to include 'recovered' items
- Added admin routes for setting 'recovered' and 'removed' statuses
- Updated templates to display new statuses with appropriate colors
- Added status history tracking

## Enhanced Item Lifecycle Management

### Features Added
1. **Status History Tracking** - Complete audit trail of all status changes
2. **Enhanced Admin Dashboard** - Status distribution visualization
3. **Item Detail View** - Status history for individual items
4. **Defined Status Transitions** - Clear rules for status changes

### Implementation Details
- Added `ItemStatusHistory` model to track status changes
- Created `change_item_status` helper function
- Added `item_history` route and template
- Enhanced admin dashboard with status distribution
- Added status summary statistics

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
CREATE TABLE item_status_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    from_status VARCHAR(20),
    to_status VARCHAR(20),
    changed_by INTEGER,
    changed_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (item_id) REFERENCES item (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (changed_by) REFERENCES user (id)
);
```

## Mobile App Updates

2. `POST /admin/items/remove/<int:id>` - Mark item as removed
3. `GET /admin/items/<int:item_id>/history` - View item status history

### Updated Endpoints
1. `/api/search` - Now includes 'recovered' items in results
2. `/api/analytics` - Now includes statistics for new statuses

### API Response Changes
