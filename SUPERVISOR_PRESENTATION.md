## ðŸ”§ Data Persistence Solution

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Data was being lost after deployment (users, items, etc.)
- **Root Cause**: Render uses ephemeral storage that gets wiped on each deployment
- **Impact**: Users had to re-register and items were lost

### Solution Implemented
1. **Persistent Storage**: Configured 1GB persistent disk on Render
2. **Database Path**: Set to `/opt/render/project/src/persistent_data/found_it.db`
3. **Environment Variables**: Proper DATABASE_PATH configuration
4. **Deployment Script**: Enhanced `deploy.sh` with database verification
5. **Backup System**: Automatic backup creation before deployments

### Technical Details
```yaml
# render.yaml configuration
services:
  - type: web
    name: found-it-app
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: bash deploy.sh
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_PATH
        value: /opt/render/project/src/persistent_data/found_it.db
    disk:
      name: persistent-storage
      mountPath: /opt/render/project/src
      sizeGB: 1
```
